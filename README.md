If you encounter any issues calling the Yelp API through my CORS proxy server, please get in contact with me.

## API issue fixed!

You hungry bro? Look for the best rated restaurants in your area by using this little app to see local, high rated restaurants on Yelp: https://ravenousfood-vic.surge.sh/

## Best Match

Searches restraunts with similar or exact search terms. Great for searching for a specific restaurant.

## Highest Rated

Searches for restaurants in descedning order from best reviewed to worst reviewed. Great for if you're in the mood for a great dining experience.

## Most Reviewed

This will display popular restaurants with more reviews in descending order of the amount of views a restaurant has. 

## Built with React JS

Run `npm start` in the terminal at the root of the project. You'll find the app running at http://localhost:3000.

**Note**: You'll have to get your own API key from Yelp if you wanna run this locally. More info here: https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/get_started. Insert your API key in `/src/util/Yelp.js:1`

Happy coding!
