# 🍲 Ravenous 🍲

## - ![#f03c15](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f03c15/f03c15.png) There is an issue with calling the Yelp API. I'm working on setting up a proxy CORS server to interact with the API, will be fixed soon.

You hungry bro? Look for the best rated restaurants in your area by using this little app to see local, high rated restaurants on Yelp: https://ravenousfood-vic.surge.sh/

## Best Match

Searches restraunts with similar or exact search terms. Great for searching for a specific restaurant.

## Highest Rated

Searches for restaurants in descedning order from best reviewed to worst reviewed. Great for if you're in the mood for a great dining experience.

## Most Reviewed

This will display popular restaurants with more reviews in descending order of the amount of views a restaurant has. 

## Built with React JS

Run `npm start` in the terminal at the root of the project. You'll find the app running at `http://localhost:3000`.

**Note**: You'll have to get your own API key from Yelp if you wanna run this locally. More info here: https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/get_started

Happy coding!
